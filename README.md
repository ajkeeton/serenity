# Serenity
A library for creating RESTful services in C++11 and beyond.


## Purpose
The purpose of Serenity is to provide C++ developers an easy way to create
services that expose REST APIs to clients.

## TODO

    * File Handler
    * Extra URI parts as arguments
    * Request handler for different URI prefixes
        * Ie.  /files/[path to file] would run a specific handler to return files.
          and /api/v1/blah would execute API v1 handlers.
